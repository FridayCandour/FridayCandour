# Hi there! 👋 I’m Friday Candour

Imagine a world where technology doesn’t just function—it inspires.
<br>
<br>

I am Friday Candour, a tech Engineer on a mission to reshape the digital landscape.
Ever since I first booted up a Linux machine, I’ve been hooked on the power of code to turn wild ideas into reality. Driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, I craft tools and solutions that solve problems and spark creativity.
<br>
Like a scientist unraveling the deep secrets, I dive into code to push the boundaries of what’s possible
<br>
<br>
—let’s create something extraordinary together!
<br>
<br>

## Technologies I Use

My toolkit and my expertise are my superpower, honed for building impactful solutions:

- **🐧 Linux**: I'm a Linux enthusiast with experience across some languages but most especially.
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: My go-to for crafting dynamic, user-focused web experiences in less time.
  - **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, nextjs, Vue and angular for Frontend, Express, jetpath and bunks for robust back-ends, I build seamless applications with tools like these.
  - **React Native & Flutter**: For building cross-platform mobile apps that feel native and perform flawlessly.
  - **Golang & Zig**: My choice for high-performance applications.

These aren’t just tools—they’re the building blocks I use to turn visions into reality.

## My Approach

Great software is a blends of creativity and quality. I tackle every project with a test driven development, exploring, refining and getting user feedback, delivering useful solutions to problems. Collaboration fuels me; I thrive when ideas flow freely and innovation becomes a team effort. Let’s work together!

<br>
<br>

## What’s Cooking?

- Building tools that empower creators and techies.
- Diving into distributed systems and performance optimization.
- Exploring AI’s intersection with software to craft smarter solutions.  
  I’m always learning, always evolving—because in tech, standing still isn’t an option.
