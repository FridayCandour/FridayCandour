# Friday Candour

<br>

I am Friday Candour, a Software Engineer on a mission to reshape the digital landscape.

I‚Äôve been hooked on the power of science to turn ideas into reality. Driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, I create tools and solutions that solve problems.
<br>
<br>

## Technologies I Use

My toolkit and my expertise are my superpower:

- **üêß Linux**: I'm a Linux user, used bunch of linux distros, I used arch btw :)
- With experience across some languages but most especially.
  - **TypeScript**: My go-to for crafting dynamic, user-focused web experiences fast.
  - **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Nextjs for Frontend, Express, Jetpath and Bunjs for robust back-ends, I build seamless applications with tools like these.
  - **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile apps that feel native and perform flawlessly.
  - **Golang & Zig**: My choice for high-performance applications.
